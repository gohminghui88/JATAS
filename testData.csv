4,"The opportunity to learn as much as possible and to maximise my four years of education here in NTU. However there are some things that I can't seem to wrap my head around to:  1) Minimum number of AUs to graduate; we are told we have a minimum number of AUs to fulfil so as to graduate, however why are we denied from taking more AUs than the 'minimum' if we manage to cleared the required number of AUs before graduation. Given that NTU offer so many modules so that student can maximise their learning and interest, why are we denied the chance to learn more?   2) Why are we not able to S/U our modules upon receiving our examinations results? By utilising our S/U before the results, most of the students are gambling with their grades. It is difficult to judge how well we do when we only get to know 50% or less of our total grades most of the time.  3) Would there be a chance for some language course to be offered free S/U mods? Given that many students have been complaining about the steep bell curve of language modules and most students S/U their language mods. Perhaps official languages of Singapore such as Tamil, Mandarin Chinese and Malay could be offered as free S/U modules to promote cultural exchanges and social cohesion."

But as I hate to say, I am quite disappointed because I don't see a point that students study for one whole semester, rushing through modules after modules, just to sit for an exam which will determine if you are good enough. There are not enough details content and the contents of modules have no real life examples or scenarios that can help us students understand better to why do we have to do/learn this."

3,"I have faced so many issues while in NTU, that my counterparts in NUS do not.  For example, the application on stars planner is a very troublesome process. Because I had failed a module in my previous semester, I was given a later slot in my course registration. Which caused me to not get many of my core modules as the slots were all taken. And I only managed to secure 6AU out of the 18AU i had intended.  Which meant that I had to either fill the remaining AUs with my next year's mods or extend my course of study.  When I asked the school for help, there wasn't much help for me.  I compare with NUS as there is a system in place there that actually works. Although the students bid for their modules, their core modules are definitely given to the students.    Another issue me and many other of my friends are facing is that it is very hard to secure IO placing. The application through the school has been fruitful for many but also not fruitful for many. We are forced to source ourselves and we are unable to secure companies as they do not want students for just a 3 month period.   I understand that the school is making IA compulsory for students. But after asking a few of my juniors, they say that its a very problematic rule, especially for students from poly who go into 2nd year direct. They feel that having just 5 semesters to complete their modules requirement for mechanical engineering course along with FYP is just too much. They have to either overload their semesters or are forced to extend their course of studies.   I feel that this issue can be avoided if you had given the poly students the option to exempt themselves from IO and IA. This is a system followed by NUS for the students of this very same degree programme.     I feel that my experience in NTU has been alright actually. But due to some policies in place that cause allot of issue for us, I feel that my experience hasn't been very good."

Thus on the issue of research and FYP, I do hope the school can provie more support and funding for the expansion its collection materials be it library books or online databases. Finally, I do hope that the school can help attract and expand the existing number of faculty staff for the history division. While I am very appreciative and thankful to the professors for all they have done to help provide us with a comprehensive history program, I would personally like to further expand my knowledge in World History which is not the specialisation for most of the current faculty members, especially with regards to Eastern European history.  To experience education in a foreign country, I am thankful for the various opportunities the school has provided in the various exchange programmes and hope the school will continue to seek out and liase with schools that has a strong standing in humanities and social sciences so as to expand the options available to my faculty mates.  While I have had a reasonably fulfilling student life in my past two years with the school, having participated in activities in line with my interests, the new regulations for club activities, especially with regards to the tightening of freshmen welcome activities has been rather frustrating for it has limited our program options greatly. I understand that safety concerns has taken the front seat in recent years, but I hope the school can soften its stand on this issue, and consider approval of plans on a case by case basis base off the individual club's track record and of course, the comprehensiveness of the individual proposals."

NTU is a pot of different cultures what is great but at the beginning, it is not easy to adapt to the system for the non-traditional foreigner so I think it is necessary a mentor-ship program where they can talk/listen about others experiences. Other International universities like UCD have a 'first-friend program'.     * For research student, the perception I feel from my classmates is that professors (sometimes, even the students) don't care about what class their student attend as soon as it is easy to get the credits and carry on with the research. I know that the time is limited and within 18 month the student have to finish all the credits and pass the QE but then classes are purposeless."

Thus far, having been with NTU and NIE for 5 years, I observe a pattern of academics too hung up on publishing papers in their own areas, and I have a tenured associate professor who actually said out in a class that he loathes teaching us as it takes away his time to deliver to the timeline to publish papers. I have another associate professor sharing on how many points each postgraduate research students is worth, in advancing the career. All this bodes down to selfish interests, and makes me wonder if I went to the right institution to obtain my objectives to learn and develop knowledge with true 'teachers'. Having said that, the saving grace is in one professor who takes time to share knowledge and demonstrate the values of an educator."
